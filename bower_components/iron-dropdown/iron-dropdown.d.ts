/**
 * `<iron-dropdown>` is a generalized element that is useful when you have
 * hidden content (`dropdown-content`) that is revealed due to some change in
 * state that should cause it to do so.
 *
 * Note that this is a low-level element intended to be used as part of other
 * composite elements that cause dropdowns to be revealed.
 *
 * Examples of elements that might be implemented using an `iron-dropdown`
 * include comboboxes, menubuttons, selects. The list goes on.
 *
 * The `<iron-dropdown>` element exposes attributes that allow the position
 * of the `dropdown-content` relative to the `dropdown-trigger` to be
 * configured.
 *
 *     <iron-dropdown horizontal-align="right" vertical-align="top">
 *       <div slot="dropdown-content">Hello!</div>
 *     </iron-dropdown>
 *
 * In the above example, the `<div>` assigned to the `dropdown-content` slot will be
 * hidden until the dropdown element has `opened` set to true, or when the `open`
 * method is called on the element.
